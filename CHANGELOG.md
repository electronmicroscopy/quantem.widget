# Changelog

One line per release candidate: the main user-facing thing that changed. Newest
first. Add an entry under **Unreleased** as you land a change; move it under the
new `rcN` heading when that rc is published to TestPyPI.

## Unreleased

- Show3D temporal averaging (avg_window) moved to a GPU compute shader - avg=15 scrubs as fast as avg=1 (was a CPU per-pixel loop on the UI thread).

- `io.read_image` loads any common format (tif/png/jpg/bmp/npy/dm3/dm4 + non-Velox emd) into a `Dataset2d`.
- `io.read_images(folder)` loads a whole folder of mixed-format images into a `list[Dataset2d]`.

## rc22

- Scale bar auto-picks nm/Å/pm so labels are clean integers (no more 0.5 nm decimals).

## rc16

- Show4DSTEM browser folder-GUI workflow fix.
